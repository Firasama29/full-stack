- This simple project demonstrates how to create a basic calculator using html and javascript

- In this project, we get introduced to functions and 'document.getElementById().innerText

- What I've learned:
    - textContent is similar to innerText
    - how to perform the calculation when we click on a button
    - how to reset the result to 0 when we click on a reset button
    - how to restart the count from 0 after clicking the reset button
