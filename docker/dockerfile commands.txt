- Dockerfile: a text document that contains all the commands used to build an image. When we tell Docker to build 
			our image by executing the docker build command, Docker reads these instructions and execute them sequentially 
			and creates a Docker image.
- Build's context: is a set of files at a specified location (PATH or URL)
- PATH: is a directory to local filesystem
- URL: git repository location
	(Do not use your root directory, /, as the PATH for your build context, as it causes the build to transfer the entire contents of your
	 hard drive to the Docker daemon.)


				
			

Dockerfile commands
---------------------
	docker build .												-> . (dot) refers to current directory
	docker build -f /PATH .										-> to point to a Dockerfile in the specified path
    docker build -t test/myapp .								-> to specify a repository and tag at which to save the new image after build success
	docker build -t test/myapp:1.0.2 -t test/myapp:latest .		-> to tag the image into multiple repositories after build success
	docker run -it image_name sh
	
	# syntax parser directive	:  instructs the Docker builder what syntax to use when parsing the Dockerfile,
								   and allows older Docker versions with BuildKit enabled to upgrade the parser before starting the 
								   build. Parser directives must appear before any other comment, whitespace, or 
								   Dockerfile instruction in your Dockerfile, and should be the first line in Dockerfiles.
	
	docker/dockerfile:1			:  always points to the latest release of the version 1 syntax


	FROM openjdk:16-alpine3.13	:  tells Docker what base image we would like to use for our application. Weâ€™ll use the official 
								   Maven image with Java JDK that already has all the tools and packages that we need to run a Java 
								   application.
			(images can be inherited from other images, therefore we can use maven's image)
	
	
	docker build				: builds docker images from a Dockerfile and context
				

			
	docker images				: view images
