		>> HashMap class	:
				>>>> a hashtable implementation of a map interface

				>>>> unsynchronized: it multiple threads access it concurrently and at least one thread modifies it structurally, 
					 it must be synchronized externally
				>>>> allows one null key and multiple null values
				>>>> doesn't maintain insertion order
				>>>> provides constant time performance O(1) for get, contains and remove operations
				
		>> LinkedHashMap class
				>>>> hashtable and linked list implementation off map interface
				>>>> uses hashing mechanism
				>>>> unsynchronized: it multiple threads access it concurrently and at least one thread modifies it structurally, 
					 it must be synchronized externally
				>>>> maintains a doubly-linked list running through all its entries
				>>>> this linkedList defines the ordering of entries
				>>>> allows one null key and multiple null values
				>>>> maintains insertion order
				>>>> can be configured to return access order(order in which elements were accessed, from least-recently to most-recently)
				>>>> provides constant time performance O(1) for get, contains and remove operations

	NOTE: Initial Capacity and Load Factors are two parameters of HashSet, Hashtable and HashMap
		
		> Initial capacity
			- is the number of buckets of a hashtable/hashset/hashmap
			- initial capacity is capacity at the time hashtable/hashset/hashmap are created
			- initial capacity for hashset is 16 and for hashtable is 11
			
		> load factor
			- is a measure of how full a hashtable/hashset/hashmap can get before its capacity is automatically increased
			- default capacity for hashtable/hashset/hashmap is 0.75
