Comparable interface

	how to use comparable interface to compare between 2 objects:
	
		public class Example implements Comparable<Example> {
		
			@Override
			public int compareTo(Example o) {
				return this.id - o.getId();
			
			}
		}
		
		
		- if the id of the argument object is higher than the id of the object, result will return a negative value
		- if the id of the argument object is less than the id of the object, result will return a positive value
		- if the ids of both objects are equal, result will be zero
