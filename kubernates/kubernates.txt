	how to use kubernetes to deploy an application?
	
	Use deployment.yaml file and service.yaml file
		- the deployment file is used to oversee the pods running the application itself
		
		- the service is used to expose the application
		
	- kubernetes OBJECTS:
		- they are persistent entities that kubernetes use to represent the state of a cluster. They describe:
			-> what containerized applications are running (and on which nodes)
			-> resources available for thise applications
			-> policies around how those applications should behave (restart policies, upgrades, fault-tolerance)
		- Once you create a kubernetes object, kubernetes makes sure it continues to exist
		- You can use kubectl to create, update, delete the objects.
		---------------------------------------------
		- Objects spec VS. Objects status
			----> status (nested object):
				----> represents the current status of your object, supplied by kubernetes. kubernetes actively manages the actual state of the application to match the desired state
			----> spec (nested object):
				----> represents the desired state
		---------------------------------------------
		- Types of kubernetes objects:
			----> Deployment
				----> an object that represents an application running in your cluster
				----> One way to create a Deployment using a .yaml file is to use the kubectl apply command passing the .yaml file as an argument:
					<<<< kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment.yaml --record >>>>
					output:
					<<<< deployment.apps/nginx-deployment created >>>>
					
				----> structure:
					apiversion: app/v1
					kind: Deployment
				------------------
			----> Service
				----> structure
					apiversion: v1
					kind: Service
				------------------
			----> Pod (https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/)
				----> structure
					apiversion: v1
					kind: Pod
