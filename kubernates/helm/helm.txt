	- what is helm?
	helm is a tool for managing kubernates packages (charts)
	
	- how helm works:
		* create helm charts
		* package charts into chart archive (tgz) files
		* interact with chart repositories where charts are stored
		* install and uninstall charts into an existing kubernates cluster
		* manage release cycle of charts that were installed with helm
		
	- important helm concepts
		* chart: a bundle of information that helps create an instance of kubernates application
		* config: contains configuration information that can be merged into packaged charts to create releasable objects
		* release: a running instance of helm chart
	helm directory structure
	
	Chart.yaml		-> contains information about helm chart (https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-chartyaml-file)
	values.yaml		-> default configuration values for the chart
	/templates		-> this directory along with values.yaml will be used to generate valid kubernates manifest files
