     > What is Persistence Context
          - It's a first-level cache where object instances are stored to the database or fetched from the database
          - It resides between the application and persistence database
          - keeps track of changes to the managed entity. If there are any changes during a transaction, the entity is marked
            as dirty, and if the transaction completes, the entity is flushed to the database
          - It's benefitial because calls to the database are expensive and impacts performance. So Persistence Context offers
            temporary storage to reduce the number of calls to database
          - EntityManager checks for Persistence Context. If it doesn't find it, it will create a new one

     > Types of Persistence Context:
     	1. Transaction-scoped
     	     - enabled by default
     	     - bound to a transaction. When a transaction is completed, the entity is flushed to the database
     	     - @PersistenceContext
     	        private EntityManager em;
     	        
     	2. Extended-scoped
     	     - In this case, Persistence Context can span across multiple transactions
     	     - We can persist the entity without a transaction but we cannot flush it without a transaction
     	     - @PersistenceContext(type=PersistenceContexttype.EXTENDED)
     	       private EntityManager em;
