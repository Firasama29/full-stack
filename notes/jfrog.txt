jfrog

	---responsibilities:
	1. used for storing and managing artifacts
	2. used for downloading and managing dependencies
	
	- usually when we need a dependency, build tool like maven is responsible to download the dependency
	- jfrog can act as a buffer/ proxy to download the dependency from remote repository and store it locally which then can be used by the build tool
