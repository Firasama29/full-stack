CharSequence vs String

Source (https://www.baeldung.com/java-char-sequence-string)

	CHARSEQUENCE

	- CharSequence is an interface that represents a sequence of characters
	- It does not force mutability, so both mutable and immutable classes can implement charSequence
	- Since it is an interface, it cannot be instantiated directly, so an implementation is needed to instantiate a variable
		For example, StringBuilder and StringBuffer
		
		CharSequence charSequence = new StringBuilder("charsequence instantiation using a StringBuilder");
		
		CharSequence charSequence2 = new StringBuffer("charsequence instantiation using a StringBuffer");
		
	
	STRING
	
	- A string is a class and a sequence of characters.
	- A string is immutable
	- A string implements Serializable, Comparable<String> and CharSequence.
	
	
	String and CharSequence are not equal to each other
