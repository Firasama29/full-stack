	String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder
	
	Source(https://www.baeldung.com/java-string-builder-string-buffer)
	
	String
	
	- String is an immutable class so it cannot be modified.
	- When attempting to modify a String, a new object is created
	
			String string = "test";
			string = "test2";
			
			output = "test2"
	
--------------------	
	StringBuffer
	
	- StringBuffer is a mutable sequence of characters, so it can be modified using .append() method
	- StringBuffer is synchronized so it is thread safe
	
		StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer("test");
		stringBuffer.append(" test2");
		
		output = "test test2"
--------------------
	StringBuilder
	
	- StringBuilder is a mutable sequence of characters so it can be modified using .append() method
	- Unlike StringBuffer, StringBuilder is not synchronized therefore not thread safe
	- Since it is not thread safe, it is faster than StringBuffer and recommended in single-thread programs
		
		StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder("test");
		stringBuilder.append(" test2");
		
		output = "test test"
		
	NOTE: performance difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder is insignificant
