	- Relational Mapping

		- @OneToOne and @ManyToOne have default eager fetchType
		- @ManyToMany and @OneToMany have default lazy fetchType
		
		
		@OneToMany and @ManyToOne
			- two tables are linked based on a foreign key column in a child table which references a primary key of a parent table row
		- You can use @JoinColumn with @OneToOne and @ManyToOne
	
		- mappedBy is required for bidirectional relationships
	
		- @JoinColumn should be used in the target entity that will have the foreign key
	
	
	- spring.jpa.show-sql: true to show ddl in the logs
	
	- spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql: true to format and pretty print SQL queries
	
	- jpa.hibernate.ddl.auto has multiple options (SEE FILE hibernate_ddl_auto)
	
	- logging: 
		config: classpath:logback/logblack-${spring.profiles.active}.xml
		- make sure you define ${spring.profiles.active} property in application file (SEE BELOW DETAILS FOR profile property
		- make sure to create a logback file based on each profile
		
	- spring.profiles.active
		- the value should be set as follows:
			>> in application.yaml or application.properties: 	local
			>> in helm/values.yaml:								dev
			>> in helm/values-uat.yaml:							uat
			>> in helm/values-sit.yaml: 						sit
			>> in helm/values-prod.yaml:						prod
